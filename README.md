# Slot Machine

This is an app for creating and managing what components go into what slots on the guardian site, and
the conditions upon which they appear.

This is a WHAT-IF WEEK project!

## About the app

This is a yarn+webpack+react app, with two dependencies: material-ui and react-router.
    
## Running, etc

We started from create-react-app, so standard ```yarn start```,  ```yarn test```, ```yarn build``` scripts are available.

```
git clone git@github.com:guardian/slot-machine.git
cd slot-machine
nvm use
yarn
<edit the config.js file>
yarn start
```
